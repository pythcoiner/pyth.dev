# nSequence

## Where is nSequence?

nSequence is a member `CTxIn` class in bitcoin-core:

```cpp
/** An input of a transaction.  It contains the location of the previous
 * transaction's output that it claims and a signature that matches the
 * output's public key.
 */
class CTxIn
{
public:
    COutPoint prevout;
    CScript scriptSig;
    uint32_t nSequence;
    CScriptWitness scriptWitness; //!< Only serialized through CTransaction

    /**
     * f 
     * Setting nSequence to this value for every input in a transaction
     * disables nLockTime/IsFinalTx().
     * It fails OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY/CheckLockTime() for any input that has
     * it set (BIP 65).
     * It has SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG set (BIP 68/112).
     */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_FINAL = 0xffffffff;
    /**
     * This is the maximum sequence number that enables both nLockTime and
     * OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (BIP 65).
     * It has SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG set (BIP 68/112).
     */
    static const uint32_t MAX_SEQUENCE_NONFINAL{SEQUENCE_FINAL - 1};

    // Below flags apply in the context of BIP 68. BIP 68 requires the tx
    // version to be set to 2, or higher.
    /**
     * If this flag is set, CTxIn::nSequence is NOT interpreted as a
     * relative lock-time.
     * It skips SequenceLocks() for any input that has it set (BIP 68).
     * It fails OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY/CheckSequence() for any input that has
     * it set (BIP 112).
     */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG = (1U << 31);

    /**
     * If CTxIn::nSequence encodes a relative lock-time and this flag
     * is set, the relative lock-time has units of 512 seconds,
     * otherwise it specifies blocks with a granularity of 1. */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_TYPE_FLAG = (1 << 22);

    /**
     * If CTxIn::nSequence encodes a relative lock-time, this mask is
     * applied to extract that lock-time from the sequence field. */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_MASK = 0x0000ffff;

    /**
     * In order to use the same number of bits to encode roughly the
     * same wall-clock duration, and because blocks are naturally
     * limited to occur every 600s on average, the minimum granularity
     * for time-based relative lock-time is fixed at 512 seconds.
     * Converting from CTxIn::nSequence to seconds is performed by
     * multiplying by 512 = 2^9, or equivalently shifting up by
     * 9 bits. */
    static const int SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_GRANULARITY = 9;

```

To summarize:

 -(1) if bit 31 == 1 IN ALL INPUTS -> `nLocktime` is disabled [see #18096](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18096/files)
 -(2) if some data in [bit0-bit15] -> value of the _relative_ locktime
 -(3) if bit 21 == 1 and (2) -> relative_locktime = (2) * 512 seconds
 -(4) if bit 21 == 0 and (2) -> relative_locktime = (2) blocks

NOTE: `nLocktime` used for anti-fee-sniping
NOTE2: `RBF` used nsequence
